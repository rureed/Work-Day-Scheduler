Russ Reed's Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple display of work hours from 9am to 5pm.

In the middle of each "hour row", the user can input data and save it with the save button at the right end of each row, which saves the data to localStorage. When the page is refreshed, the data persists. Each save button only saves the data in its own row.

This scheduler does not color code the rows according to the time of day (past/present/future).
